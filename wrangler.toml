#
# [[kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "CACHE"

# [queues]

[vars]
# TURNSTILE_SECRET = "your-turnstile-secret-here" # Optional: only needed if you want Turnstile anti-abuse
# ACCESS_AUD = "your-access-aud-here" # Optional: for JWT validation

# Note: Click consumer worker should be deployed separately
# Run: cd workers/click-consumer && npx wrangler deploy
# Or configure in Cloudflare Dashboard as a Worker that consumes oklinks-clicks queue
